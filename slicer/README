The files in this directory are configuration files for OrcaSlicer.

Rather than copying these files to your OrcaSlicer appdata directory, use a junction to keep them in sync with this repository:
1. Remove `C:\Users\wande\AppData\Roaming\OrcaSlicer\user\default`
2. In command prompt, create a junction to this folder: `mklink /J "C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\OrcaSlicer\user\default" .`

This will ensure that this repository is kept up to date with any changes made to the configuration files.
